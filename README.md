## Time Capsule – Initial Release

Users input a “year” – Search returns key pop culture milestones:
* Entertainment: Oscar, Grammy, etc.
* Sporting Events: Super Bowl, World Series, etc.
* History: Census, President, etc.

Users can post – “What do you remember?”
* Users input favorite fashion, movies, quotes, memories, etc.
* Posts are added to the decades pages so that other users can scroll through and really get the feeling of each decade
* The idea is to allow the users to build a database much like users add calorie counts to weight loss apps or articles to Wikipedia
* The feeling is more fun and pop culture
