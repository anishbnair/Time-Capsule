## Time Capsule – Initial Release

Users input a “year” – Search returns key pop culture milestones:
* Entertainment: Oscar, Grammy, etc.
* Sporting Events: Super Bowl, World Series, etc.
* History: Census, President, etc.

Users can post – “What do you remember?”
* Users input favorite fashion, movies, quotes, memories, etc.
* Posts are added to the decades pages so that other users can scroll through and really get the feeling of each decade
* The idea is to allow the users to build a database much like users add calorie counts to weight loss apps or articles to Wikipedia
* The feeling is more fun and pop culture


## Time Capsule – Future Releases Plan

Admin Functionality
* Continue to build and maintain the historical database
* Remove troublesome posts or users

User Interface
* Add ability to add pictures
* Add ability to create likes or ability to flag poor actors
* Add ability to save favorites
* Add sort for users to view by ”Most Recent” or “Most Liked”
* Add search capability

User Experience
* Transition from blog display to a scrapbook display
* As the number of posts grown, use the topic data to add an additional drill down on the decade list to specific categories like fashion or music
* Allow a more personalized approach where users could make a shared decades virtual library to share with friends and family or create cards and scrapbooks
